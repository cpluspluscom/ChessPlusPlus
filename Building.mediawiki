Building the project is relatively simple. Firstly, you need to make sure you have [http://www.boost.org/ boost] and [http://www.sfml-dev.org/ SFML 2.0] installed and built properly. After that, it depends on your operating system and/or compiler.

== *nix and *nix-like ==
Simply build via the <tt>Makefile</tt> in the root directory.

== Windows ==
On Windows, we recommend that you use [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW], or [http://clang.llvm.org/ clang++] in combination with MinGW (the "[http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.2 experimental]" version for MinGW works on Windows).

Make sure you list all cpp files (you can do <tt>*.cpp</tt> for each directory that contains cpp files) and that you link to the proper SFML libraries (and any boost libraries if the project at some point starts using ones that need compiling).

Also, note that the executable must be placed in the same folder as config.xml - the program gets resource paths based off of that location. If the executable is ran from any other location, the program will error out.
