Style Guide & Coding Conventions
================================
- Indentation is to be consistently four spaces, not tabs or a mixture of spaces and tabs.
- All files are to have a single blank line at their end, if possible.
- Prefer C++11 features to C++03 features when possible, and avoid deprecated language features.
- When using C++11 features, try to use those which are supported by at least both clang++ and gcc
- Prefer to use `<c____>` rather than `<____.h>` for C standard library headers
- Prefer use of `class` to `struct` for declaring classes (this means you need to explicitly specify public inheritance).
- Prefer to use file extensions .cpp and .hpp (using .h may cause the file to be detected as C or Objective-C rather than C++)
- Prefer `lowercase` for parameter and local variable names.
- Prefer `UpperCamelCase` for class and type names
- Prefer `lowerCamelCase` for member function names
- Prefer `lower_case_underscore` for private member names
- Prefer `lwrabbrcase` for namespace names
- Braces should be on their own lines, even for empty definitions
- Namespaces cause indentation to occur, inclusion guards do not
- Avoid using raw pointers when possible
- Prefer creating `using` declarations to using raw primitive types
- Avoid use of exceptions when possible
- Avoid ambiguous or non-obvious public interfaces that would otherwise require documentation
- Prefer code that makes less assumptions and allows more flexibility to client code
- Prefer using e.g. functions defined in `<algorithm>` to using common idioms - this allows refactoring to be more obvious and/or straightforward
- First design abstract/high-level/object-oriented code, and optimize later as needed
- Use nameless scopes in functions to emphasize the lifetime of RAII objects
- Place source file helper functions/classes in anonymous namespaces AND declare them static, so as to avoid name/symbol conflicts across irrelevant source files
- Keep clear the separation between client and server behaviors and responsibilities
