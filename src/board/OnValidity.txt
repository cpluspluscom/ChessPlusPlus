On Validity:

The Position class has a boolean member "valid".
This member is used when calculating the trajectory of a piece
The trajectory of the piece is a list of Positions that, say the board where emtpy, the piece could move to

( A piece also has a Position for its place in the piece texture, validity is not used here)

Validity is not to be confused with the Position being out-of-bounds.
  - There is inBounds() for that.

Given the example

R * * b * * k

Where R is a White rook, b is a Black bishop, k is the Black king, and * is empty

We calculate the trajectory of the rook as:

- V V V x x x

Where "-" is not in the trajectory, V is valid, and x is not

The rook can take the bishop because it is valid, but is blocked from the king

This allows us to say something like:
  If the black king is in my trajectory and this Position is valid
    then the king is in check

It also allows for more complicated things:
    Piece checking = the piece putting my king in check (which there can be more than one)

    if a move in my valid trajectory does not cause the king to become invalid in checkings's trajectory
        then I can not move there
    (ignoring the case where I capture checking)

    if I am in a piece's valid trajectory and my king is in that piece's invalid trajectory
    and if I tried to move the king would become valid
        then I can not move there
